## Javascript: Book List App

## Overview
This project is a simple Book List App built using Vanilla JavaScript. The app allows users to add and delete books from a list. The main goal of this project was to improve my knowled of JavaScript by learning how to work with the DOM, handle events, and implement data storage.

## Features

- **Add a Book**: Users can add a book by providing details like the title, author, and ISBN.
- **Delete a Book**: Users can remove a book from the list with the click of a button.
- **Store Data**: I learned how to add and retrieve data from local storage, allowing books to persist across page reloads.

## What I Learned

- **DOM Manipulation**: I gained practical experience selecting and manipulating DOM elements to dynamically add and remove books from the UI.
- **Event Handling**: I learned how to listen for and respond to user interactions like form submissions and button clicks.
- **Data Storage**: Implemented data storage using `localStorage` to persist book information even after the page is refreshed.
- **Store Locator**: I enhanced my understanding of how to locate and store data in a structured way within the app.
- **Function Calls and Reusability**: I explored how to structure functions to be reusable for different parts of the application, improving the maintainability of the code.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/katherinegerman/booklist-app.git

 2. Open the index.html file in a web browser to view and use the app.
    
## How It Works

Fill out the book details in the form (title, author, and ISBN).
Click the "Add Book" button to add the book to the list.
Each book entry has a "Delete" button. Click this button to remove a book from the list.
Books are stored in the browser's localStorage so that the list is preserved after refreshing the page.

##Future Improvements
Add edit functionality to allow users to update book details.
Implement search functionality to find books by title or author.
Improve UI/UX with better design and visual feedback.
